# Encode Emojis

> A javascript library that encodes emojis (only emojis!) to HTML entities.

---

## Installation

This library is published to npm registry as `encode-emojis`.

You can install it:

```sh
# with npm
npm install --save encode-emojis

# with yarn
yarn add encode-emojis
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è **HINT**: This library is a pure ESM package. (You may want to

## Usage

```ts
import { encodeEmojis } from 'encode-emojis';

let text = '<strong>Hello!</strong> üëã';

text = encodeEmojis(text);

console.log(text); // -> '<strong>Hello!</strong> &#x1f44b;'
```
